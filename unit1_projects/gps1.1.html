    <h1>Pair Programming</h1>
    <p>Pair programming is the practice of two people collaborating on the same coding challenge.  
    One these challenges, a person is designated navigator and the other the driver.</p>
    <div class="navigator">
       <h3>The Navigator</h3>
       <p>The navigator is typically the director of ideas, guiding the direction of the content. 
       The navigator communicates directives to the driver.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="driver"> 
      <h3>The Driver</h3>
      <p>In pair programming, the driver typically is the person at the keyboard.  
      They take instruction from and implement the ideas of the navigator.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enters code</li>
          <li>Takes direction from the navigator</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
