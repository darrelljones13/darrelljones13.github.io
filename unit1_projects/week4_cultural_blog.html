			<p>A few weeks ago I had an emotional conflict in the workplace.  Interestingly, this wasn't with someone in my department nor was it someone I work with on a regular basis.  Just a little background on this story.  I work for a medium sized natural history museum as the Coordinator of Teacher Programs.  I design, implement, and evaluate all teacher training that the museum does.  When I was hired two plus years ago, I was told that the attendance for our non-grant funded(free) programs had been declining. This has been a challenge for me since I started.  My research has shown that few teachers are aware of the programs we offer.</p>

			<p>Flash forward to six weeks ago.  I was asked to participate in a meeting with the head of Marketing and my supervisor the head of Education. This meeting was called because the head of Marketing wanted to discuss how we can market our annual educator open house.  I was excited because, in the past we haven't received much in the way of help in marketing our education programs.  I looked at this as a positive step toward collaboration amongst deparments. </p>

			<p>The meeting began awkwardly as the head of Marketing asked me to remind him what this event was all about and how many people attended last year. I informed him that we had great attendance last year, over 200 people if I remember correctly.  This was due to the fact that the event was free and was basically a giant cocktail party for teachers.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but this event lacked the quality, research, and integrity that all of our other trainings contain. In all honesty, I got 200 teachers to come to this thing last year without any help from marketing and could probably do it again. The event was this week, and I did!  After we were finished discussing the open house, I mentioned that we were really struggling to get teachers to come to our core programs and could use some help in that realm.  I've had to cancel many workshops the last two years. He got very upset almost instantly, raising his voice and stating that he was very frustrated at me, and claiming that I didn't want his help. I was kind of in shock as he continued to berate me.  I quickly tried to recap what I had said thinking perhaps I said something I shouldn't have. He angrily asked me what my problem was?  I swallowed hard, took a deep breath and responded that I was not turning down his help, and that I was in fact asking for it down the road.  This seemed to escalate things further.  More attacks came until my supervisor stepped in and seemed to calm him down as we continued the meeting.  I spoke only when asked for the duration of the meeting.</p>

			<p>For a workplace conflict, I think I handled it as diplomatically and professionally as I could have considering how abruptly it happened.  I asked my supervisor afterward about the situation and he told me that there was nothing I said that was out of line.  After the fact, I felt I was bullied and was angry.  What could I have done?  I was meeting with a Vice President.  I can't just go toe to toe with a senior staffer in an argument.  Nothing good can come of that. In hindsight, I should have just said thank you for the help and moved on, but this was a meeting and I thought it was appropriate to address my concerns.  I am actually proud of the way I handled myself. I did not respond by getting angry or visibly animated.  I learned that I should probably practice this composure skill in the event it happens again in a similar situation.</p>

			<p>A week after this altercation, I was accepted into DBC and announced that I would be stepping down in June to pursue new career goals.  I think this would have been much tougher to handle had I not had DBC on the horizon. Nonetheless, I will mention this during my exit interview and hope that it will prevent my colleagues from having to experience this type of situation. </p>
