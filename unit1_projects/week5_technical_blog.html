			<p>There are many existing classes in Ruby such as Strings or Fixnums, but you can also create your own.  This post will outline how to do just that.</p>

			<p>Classes begin with a method - called 'initialize'. Variables with leading @ are instance (object) variables. Take a look below to see this in action with a Superhero twist. In this case, the instance variables are attributes.</p>

			<p>Within the SuperHero class, let's add another method called hero_speech. Say these heroes are ready to retire from Superheroing, and are revealing everything to the public for the first time.</p>

			<p>From here, we can actually use the SuperHero class and create new instances of it. Let's create some Superheroes by adding the following:</p>

			<div id ="image2">

			<p>And finally, we call the variable and the hero_speech method we get:</p>

			<p>This example represents a small piece of what you can do with classes in Ruby, but I hope this will serve as a springboard to foster your own curiosity with Ruby classes. Happy coding!</p>
