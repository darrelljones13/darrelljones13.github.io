			<p>Q2. Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</p>

			<p>A. Adventure is an important value to me because it encompasses a lot of the others mentioned above. My favorite thing to do is go on adventures with my wife.  This could be anything from traveling to a new place or jumping into a new life event.  We both seem to get a charge out of new things no matter how big or small. Adventure can also often mean change.  I tend to embrace change and not let the fear of something new or different get the best of me. </p>

				In general, I try to live up to these values:

				Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
