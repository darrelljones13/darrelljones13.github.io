			<p>My "mind style" ended up heavily slanted toward the abstract random end of the spectrum. This pretty accurately sums up why I can excel at group collaboration, but struggle working in restrictive environments.  From what I understand of the structure at DBC, my abilities to foster group collaboration and harmony should prove helpful.  I truly think I can be an asset to any team for this reason even though I am not the most technically skilled.  </p>

			<p>Throughout Phase 0, my biggest struggles have stemmed from a time standpoint.  I continued to work a full time+ position for eight of the nine Phase 0 weeks. I was able to complete and submit my work in time, but I wish I had more time to research and practice coding.  Aside from the time issue, working a full time job made it challenging to mentally jump back and forth from work to programming.  This is one of the downsides to being an abstract random thinker.  It is difficult to focus on one thing at a time.  I've struggled with this for quite some time.</p>
			

			<p>Having a growth mindset means that I can continue to try and better myself to overcome some of the shortfalls of having an abstract random thinking style. As simple as this sounds, one way I've learned to combat the issue of focusing on one project at a time is to make lists with check boxes. Checking items off when completed seems trivial, but is very satisfying.  It helps keep me focused on the task at hand. I hope to develop some new tools at DBC to help manage the workload in the coming weeks.</p>
