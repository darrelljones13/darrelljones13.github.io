			<h1>Week 2 Tech Blog: CSS: Margins, Borders, and Padding</h1>

			<p>For much of the first week of Phase 0, I struggled to grasp the differences between margins, borders, and padding.  I also didn't know how to use them correctly. The "box model" seems to be the best way of visually representing what each of these items are.

			<p>A Margin is the space in between individual HTML elements.  Borders are barriers separating the margins from the padding. Padding is the space in between the actual content and the border.  Within a CSS file, widths can be set for each of these.
