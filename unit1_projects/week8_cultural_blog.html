			</div>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading">
			<h3>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Pairing with others has been incredibly rewarding for me.  For the most part, I've been the least skilled of my pair and have benefitted from the incredible amount of knowledge others have been willing to share.  Almost all of my pair sessions have been productive even when I ask tons of questions.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>Meeting someone for the first time online is a bit awkward, especially when there is a delay.  We both try to be courteous and not interrupt each other, but do it anyway.  That said, the people I've paired with have been funny, charming, and incredibly positive people.  That to me, has been the best part of the process.  We fight through the awkwardness and show our true selves, and I've been fortunate to pair with some really great people.</p>
			
			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>I have a big fear that I am the weakest link in my cohort, which has contributed to some feelings of inadequacy and mediocrity.  I've thought several times over the last seven weeks that I am the least skilled programmer of the group.  I've come to understand that we all learn at a different pace, and that is totally okay.  I've learned so much in the last two months and have completed my work on time every week despite working full time.  That is something to be proud of.  I still may be the weak link in my cohort, but I will try my hardest to keep up and be the best collaborator I can be.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Feedback</h3>
			</div>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>I've always appreciated the concept of evaluation. Feedback is so important in personal and professional development.  When reading my feedback, I felt like I had similar feelings about each session.  This seemed to validate my overall thoughts about the pairing.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>Absolutely! I was worried that I asked too many questions or slowed us down by not grasping a concept, but my feedback showed that my partners enjoyed working with me.  They didn't seem to mind me asking so many questions.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>I think clearly defining the driver/navigator roles would be a good thing to work on. Throughout the majority of my pair sessions, those roles flowed more organically with us switching back and forth often.  That works for some people, but most appreciate when we deliberately make the switch.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>How was it to write feedback?</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Writing feedback was tough at first because we were all trying to figure out how to pair program.  I found myself praising my pair's levels of patience with me and their willingness to walk through concepts with me.  Overall, my feedback was a bit wishy washy and not very specific or actionable.  Since then I've gotten better at being kind, but providing meaningful feedback and citing specific instances.  People appreciate that, I know I certainly do.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</h3>
			</div>
			
			<p>This has been an incredible learning experience. I've enjoyed pairing with great people from all over the country.  There is a sense of comraderie that has been been built within our cohort.  This will ultimately benefit us all when we reach DBC.  We'll be able to jump right in together. I'm looking forward to it!</p>
