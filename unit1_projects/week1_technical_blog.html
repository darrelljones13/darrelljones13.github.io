			<h1>Week 1 Tech Blog: Analysis of 3 Websites</h1>

			<p>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target = "_blank" >Amazon.com</a>. I like Amazon so much because you can order practically anything.  I've ordered everything from graphic novels to dog food to car parts from this site.  Amazon can be overwhelming and time-consuming, but there is so much content to sift through if you are looking for the best prices. Aside from a front page plastered with special deals and sale items, you can easily navigate the site from the search bar at the top, or the department drop-down menu on the top left. They have a one-click order feature which makes purchasing really easy.

			<p>2. <a href="http://baseballamerica.com" target = "_blank">Baseball America</a>. Baseball America is the source for all things minor league baseball.  If you are a fan of player development and scouting, this is a great resource for historical data, rankings, and opinion pieces on the farm systems of major league franchises.  The overall site design is simple, streamlined, and easy to navigate.  The sidebar to the right can take you to all major sections of the site. The central focus of the page is the cycling photos and captions that can take you to the most recent content.
			</p>
			<p>3. <a href="http://zergnet.com" target = "_blank">Zergnet</a>.  This site is created to be a hub for any article, whether external or self created, dealing with geek culture.  Visually, the site is claustrophobic and cluttered with images and captions of articles as far as the eye can see.  Being a sci-fi, comic, and to a lesser extent, videogame fan, it is the content that brings me back to this site.  Though there are many images on the main page, they are sized large enough that I can find the articles I want to read and ignore the others. While not doing the world any bit of good, this site is purely candy, with easily consumable entertaining content.
