			<p>JavaScript wasn't always cool.  Most people hated the language for quite a while since its launch in the mid 90's.  Since then, it has slowly gained popularity in the web development community. So much so that it is being hailed as "the future of programming. "How did this much maligned language emerge as such a popular development tool?</p>

			<p>For one, JavaScript is what they call "beginner friendly."  I'm not sure I buy into that because I struggled mightily this past week with my first taste of the language.  This makes a lot of sense though.  It essentially works with any operating system and it doesn't cost anything.  You can create cool, interactive elements that make websites really sparkle. What I like most about JS is that it meshes well with HTML and CSS</p>
