			<p>I've been in the education field for the vast majority of my professional life.  Most recently, I have been heavily involved in training teachers in science and engineering, two of the fields in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.  This acronym was introduced to the education field near the middle part of the last decade and has since become a major buzz word (buzz-cronym?). But what does this increased focus actually mean for students?</p>

			<p>In 2012, President Obama announced a plan to create a STEM Master Teaching Corps.  This plan, which is to train teachers in the STEM fields, was designed to champion the cause of and create a generation of tech-capable students.  Students who will saturate the workforce and make the U.S. the world leader in innovation.  A noble pursuit for certain, but will this work?  Philanthropic partners across the country fund specialized STEM programs that impact small populations of students. I just finished implementing a program created to get students designing solar-powered model race cars.  It was a blast, and the students gained new knowledge and were introduced to engineering.</p>

			<p>The problem is that these programs only hit a small(usually underserved) population of students.  In Chicago Public Schools, there is no existing engineering or technology curriculum.  A handful of students getting to participate in a six week program just isn't going to cut it.  Outside of these special programs, Technology and Engineering simply don't exist in classrooms.</p>

			<p>Ultimately this falls on teachers, many of whom have terrible misconceptions about what teaching technology is.  I've coached many teachers over the last few years, some at high performing schools and some at low performing schools.  The major misconception common to all of these teachers is what technology means.  Some of these teachers worked really hard to get ipads in the classroom, which is really great.  I don't want to discount the fact that exposure to the newest tech is a great first step, but these teachers think they've got the "T" covered just because they have technology.</p>

			<p>The big issue here is that the main principles of engineering an technology do not fit into today's education system and its continued focus on standardized testing.  I'll save my thoughts on that for another post.  These principles: designing, building, tinkering, programming, FAILING, re-designing, testing, and re-testing have no place in the normal school day. Until the education system changes, the fields of technology, engineering, and even science will continue to have trouble exposing students to all the great stuff that lies within.</p>
