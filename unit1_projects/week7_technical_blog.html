			<p>SQL Injection is a method used by hackers to gain access to, and ultimately steal data. Whoa.</p>

			<p>In a nutshell, hackers can use SQL Injection to take advantage of sloppy coding, accessing databases through SQL commands and wreak all kinds of havoc.  Our banks, insurance companies, and even the federal government store much of our personal and financial information in databases.  It allows these institutions to quickly access this data to quickly provide services. If these databases aren't sufficiently protected, hackers can easily use applications to pass SQL statements to edit or delete this information.  A simple DROP TABLE statement is all it takes to delete a database. Yikes! SQL Injection has become a popular hacking technique because all you need is a web browser, knowledge of SQL, and a little patience in guessing the database fields.</p>


			<p>So, how can us newbie programmers combat SQL Injection? I've read that firewalls do little to proctect from this. Patching servers, databases, and operating systems is an important step. 


			<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet" target="_blank">The OWASP SQL Prevention Cheat Sheet</a> is an excellent resource for programmers when thinking about SQL Injection.  One strategy they suggest is using parameterized queries.  This strategies makes developers define all SQL code up front and passing parameters later.  What this does is "allows the database to distinguish code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied."  Food for thought for all of us new to SQL.
