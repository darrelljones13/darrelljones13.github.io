            <p>Many months back while researching developer jobs and deciding whether to apply to DBC, I noticed many of the job descriptions desiring experience with Ruby on Rails. Throughout my time in DBC prep and Phase 0, I have had the chance to become a bit familiar with the Ruby programming language, but we haven't learned what Rails is or how it fits with Ruby.</p>

                <h3>What is Ruby on Rails?</h3>

                <p>In simplest terms, Ruby is the programming language, and Rails is the framework.  Rails is a framework for building web applications and websites.  It interfaces with the Ruby language to provide the back-end (server-side)and other web-based languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript to provide the front-end.  Together they are the foundations of web development.  Rails allows developers to build complex sites and applications because of its extensive libraries.  Built in structure gives developers something to build on rather than starting from scratch.</p>

                    <h3>Why Ruby on Rails is so popular</h3>

                    <p>Ruby and Rails work together so well because they are both open source, which has proven to be popular with developers. This allows anyone to create, edit, and design new features to the Ruby on Rails software libraries or RubyGems.  The fact that it is constantly evolving makes it very appealing to developers around the world and it allows them to collectively advance the web.  A quick search on <a href="https://http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=ruby+on+rails&l=Chicago%2C+IL" target="_blank">Indeed.com</a> in the Chicago area shows just how many companies agree. This bodes pretty well for us future developers.</p>
