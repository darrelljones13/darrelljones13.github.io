	<p>Hi! My name is Darrell and I have been a trainer/ instructional designer in the museum industry for the last eight years. I have a background in education and digital design, but have always been interested in computer programming since I was a teenager. <br/> 

	I'm excited to be a part of DBC Chicago and begin my career as a developer.</p>
	
	<p>I'm originally from Pittsburgh, PA but have lived in Chicago for the last eleven years. I have been married to my beautiful wife, Shannon for ten years and have an American Bulldog named Oliver.</p>
