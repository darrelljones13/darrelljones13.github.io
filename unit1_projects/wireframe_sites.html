<p>Amazon is an online shopping network of sorts where a consumer can purchase just about anything.  Because Amazon has so much to offer, the front page is littered with sale items and promotions. These take up the majority of the page.</p>

<p>Baseball America is a reference site for fans, media, and scouts. It primarily focuses on the amateur draft, prospects, and minor league systems. Visually, the site is simple and streamlined with articles down the middle and an easy to navigate sidebar on the right</p>

<p>Zergnet is a site that collects stories and articles from other sites that pertain to scifi and gamer culture. The site is a conglomeration of blocks of images and text that are links to stories.  These blocks cascade down the page.</p>
