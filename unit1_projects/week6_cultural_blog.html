			<p>What is Stereotype Threat?</p>

			<p>First introduced in 1995, by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, stereotype threat deals with the emotional and physical symptoms someone feels when another confirms negative sterotypes about that person.  Steele and Aronson work highlights how these threats negatively affect a person's identity and academic performance of those in stereotyped groups.</p>

			<p>My Experiences with Stereotype Threat</p>

			<p>I should preface this with stating that I am a white male, and have most likely not had to endure stereotype threat as frequently as others. All that said, I have experienced stereotype threat in the past.  About seven years ago, I applied, interview, and was subsequently hired by a school to teach pre-kindergarten.  I participated in four interviews for the position, which isn't uncommon in the education field.  What I didn't notice at the time was why I was interviewed so many times and how many different ways I was being asked the same type of question.  I'm fairly certain I convinced them I was a solid educator after the first interview.  The subsequent interviews focused on my background.  I should say that I had already participated in the background check, fingerprinting identification, and the like.  I was/still am squeaky clean.  Knowing this, they still asked me personal information about what neighborhood I live in, what my marriage was like.  I'm convinced to this day that I would not have been hired if I was not married.  Five different interviewers asked some form of, "So, you're married right?" Most of the questions were probing for any evidence of what I would say was creepiness.  They informed me that if I was hired, I would be the first male teacher to EVER teach at the school.  After that, I understood what was happening.  They were going the extra mile to make sure I wasn't a pedophile.  I totally get why they felt they had to do it, they were protecting themselves and the children of the school.

			I was eventually hired and taught for two years at the school.  The entire time, I felt threatened.  I constantly felt I needed to go above and beyond to prove to the administration and parents that I was a great teacher and not a total creepazoid. At the beginning of the year almost every child's parent would volunteer to chaperone field trips.  They simply didn't trust me. When I finally felt like I won them over, I would have to do it all over again the next year. When a student misbehaved, I tried not to raise my voice for fear that I would be fired.  Steele's quote below appropriately summarizes how I felt.

				“When you feel under threat, you know that based on an identity you have, something bad could happen. You don’t know whether in fact it will happen. You don’t know precisely what could happen or when or where it could happen,” he said. “It’s like having a snake loose in the house. It’s a terrible feeling. When you are in this situation, most of your cognitive resources are devoted to vigilance.”</p>

			<p>What Can We Do?</p>

			<p>The best way to combat stereotype threat is awareness.  The more we make these threats apparent, the quicker they will disappear. Steele believes that these methods could range from interventions to simple changes that can easily be made.</p>
