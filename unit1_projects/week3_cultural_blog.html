			<p>Watching Shareef's fireside chat reinforced many of my reasons for applying to DBC.  For one, I have sort of a tinkering mentality.  I have really no fear of screwing up. For the last 6 plus years, I have been training science teachers.  One of the key items I've tried to pass along is that science is all about failure.  This is difficult for formal educators to hear because their mentality is to keep students from failing.  Science is about being curious, asking questions, testing, messing up, and re-testing. This thread constantly repeats itself in this field.  Mistakes are corrected with new ones popping up and all the while, new learning is happening. This happens best when working with others, which is why I love the kitchen approach so much. We're all in this together making mistakes, and learning all along the way.</p>

			<p>I absolutely loved Shareef's take on pair programming.  He effectively summarized why I've decided to become a programmer now compared to 15 years ago.  As an educator, I've learned that the ability to collaborate, share, and troubleshoot with someone else is an incredible skill to have (and continue developing).  As Shareef said, it is one of the best ways to learn because you will always work with someone a little more experienced than you and a little less experienced.  I've seen evidence of this in my experience with pairing already in these first fewnweeks. Tips, shortcuts, and huge a-ha moments that I've discovered through pairing have helped me immensely. I struggled with JavaScript this week and was starting to get down a bit.  Watching this video pulled me out of my funk and reignited my excitement to participate in DBC.  I can't see you all in Chicago with my chef's knife and cutting board! </p>
