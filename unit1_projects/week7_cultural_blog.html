			<h3>How do you feel when you think about your values?</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Way back in week one of Phase 0, I chose these values: Accomplishment, Activism, Adventure, Affection, Challenge, Confidence, Cooperation Creativity, Excitement, Friendships, Health, Helping other people, Honesty, Integrity, Leadership, Romance. </p>

			<p>I still firmly hold to these values, perhaps even more so.  Throughout Phase 0, there have been time when my confidence has plummeted due to not fully grasping a concept or really struggling with one of the challenges.  That seems to be when some of the other values kick in to push me.  I still like to be challenged, and I certainly have been during Phase 0.  I'm comfortable asking for help, and I'm not afraid to ask a stupid question or even suggest an off-the-wall idea during pair programming. I've been like that for as long as I can remember.</p>
			
			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you are in it?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>I think my awareness of stereotype threat has increased due to research I've done on the topic since last week.  This should help me recognize it faster in professional (and other) situations leading to dealing with it quickly.</p>

			<div id = "paragraph_heading"><h3>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h3>
			</div>

			<p>I'm certain there will be times when I get down during DBC.  I've already dealt with some of this during Phase 0.  My best solution for dealing with this has been to take a step back and go do something unrelated for a little while.  Most often this means going to the gym.  I find that swimming laps helps in ways I haven't quite figured out yet.  Getting your heartrate up in a non-stressful way has paid off.  I usally return to the work with a completely different mindset, refreshed, and refocused.  I know we have access to a gym during DBC, and I'm hoping I can make use of it during those unproductive, stressful times when I can feel myself starting to get down. I'm also planning on commuting to DBC via bike.  Given I live almost 9 miles away, it should be a decent workout.</p>
