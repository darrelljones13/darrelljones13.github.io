    <h2><a href="unit1_projects/week9_cultural_blog.html" target="_blank">Week 9 Cultural Blog: Thinking and Learning Styles</a></h2>
    My &quot;mind style&quot; ended up heavily slanted toward the abstract random end of the spectrum. This pretty accurately sums up why I can excel at group collaboration, but struggle working in restrictive environments.  From what I understand of the structure at DBC, my abilities to foster group collaboration and harmony should prove helpful.  I truly think I can be an asset to any team for this reason even though I am not the most technically skilled...

    <h2><a href="unit1_projects/week8_cultural_blog.html" target="_blank">Week 8 Cultural Blog: Pairing and Giving Feedback</a></h2>
    What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? Pairing with others has been incredibly rewarding for me.  For the most part, I've been the least skilled of my pair and have benefitted from the incredible amount of knowledge others have been willing to share.  Almost all of my pair sessions have been productive even when I ask tons of questions...

    <h2><a href="unit1_projects/week8_technical_blog.html" target="_blank">Week 8 Tech Blog: What is Rails?</a></h2>
    Many months back while researching developer jobs and deciding whether to apply to DBC, I noticed many of the job descriptions desiring experience with Ruby on Rails. Throughout my time in DBC prep and Phase 0, I have had the chance to become a bit familiar with the Ruby programming language, but we haven't learned yet just what Rails is or how it fits with Ruby...

    <h2><a href="unit1_projects/week7_technical_blog.html" target="_blank">Week 7 Tech Blog: SQL Injection</a></h2>
    SQL Injection is a method used by hackers to gain access to, and ultimately steal data. Whoa. In a nutshell, hackers can use SQL Injection to take advantage of sloppy coding, accessing databases through SQL commands and wreak all kinds of havoc.  Our banks, insurance companies, and even the federal government store much of our personal and financial information in databases.  It allows these institutions to quickly access this data to quickly provide services...

    How do you feel when you think about your values? Way back in week one of Phase 0, I chose these values: Accomplishment, Activism, Adventure, Affection, Challenge, Confidence, Cooperation Creativity, Excitement, Friendships, Health, Helping other people, Honesty, Integrity, Leadership, Romance.</p>..
